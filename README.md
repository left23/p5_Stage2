Isolating MIDI channels and preparing for list of countries as data


Includes the p5 MIDI API plugin from https://github.com/therewasaguy/p5.midi.
When receiving midi input, midi data from two channels is printed to the canvas and logged to the console.
Circles are drawn on mouse click and mouse press too.
